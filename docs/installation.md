# SimBAxTF or SimBA?
**!!! IMPORTANT !!!**
You can choose to install SimBA as a standalone package or install SimBA with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) integration.  

1) If you would like to be able to call [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut) or [DeepPoseKit](https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit) commands via the SimBA interface (whuch requires a local GPU), please install SimBAxTF from the **master** branch.  Please see full instructions below.

2) If you do **not** want to use TensorFlow through SimBA on your local machine, and instead have DeepLabCut/DeepPoseKit installed elsewhere, please install SimBA from the **SimBA_no_TF** branch. This does not require a GPU, or local installations of DeepLabCut or DeepPoseKit. Please see full instructions below. This version of SimBA includes **all functionalities** of SimBAxTF, except for the ability to generate pose-estimation models through the SimBA GUI. **Pose-estmation model results can still be imported and analysed**.

# Requirements
1. [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)  **<-- VALIDATED WITH 3.6.0**
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
3. [FFmpeg](https://m.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)

# Installing SimBA Option 1

### Install SimBAxTF with integrated TensorFlow (use this installation method when running DeepLabCut or DeepPoseKit locally using a GPU)
Open bash or command prompt and run the following commands on current working directory

```
pip install simba-uw-tf
```

### Install SimBA standalone package (without TensorFlow or integrated DeepLabCut/DeepPoseKit support)
Open bash or command prompt and run the following commands on current working directory

```
pip install simba-uw-no-tf
```

# How to launch SimBA ( installed using pip install simba-uw-tf)

1. Open up command prompt anywhere.

2. In the command prompt type
```
simba
```
3. Hit `Enter`.

>*Note:* If you installed simba on a virtual environment (anaconda), after installation, run `conda install shapely` for simba to work.


# Installing SimBA Option 2

### Install SimBAxTF with integrated TensorFlow (use this installation method when running DeepLabCut or DeepPoseKit locally using a GPU)
Open bash or command prompt and run the following commands on current working directory

```
git clone -b master https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba.git

pip3 install -r simba/simba/requirements.txt
```

### Install SimBA standalone package (without TensorFlow or integrated DeepLabCut/DeepPoseKit support)
Open bash or command prompt and run the following commands on current working directory

```
git clone -b SimBA_no_TF https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba.git

pip3 install -r simba/SimBA/requirements.txt
```

# How to launch SimBA (installing by cloning)

1. Open up command prompt in the SimBA folder

2. In the command prompt type
```
python SimBA.py
```
3. Hit `Enter`.

>*Note:* For this launch to work you need to [add python to the environmental path](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).
